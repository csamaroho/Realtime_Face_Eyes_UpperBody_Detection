# Realtime_Face_Eyes_UpperBody_Detection
I have created a MATLAB project based on image processing which has a GUI from where we can select options of real time face , eyes or upper body detection.
I have used viola jones algorithm in this project.A cascade object detector has been fed and trained with thousands of images then i have imported that object in my 
program to detect face,eyes and upper body in a frame of the live feed.
